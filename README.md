### Jumping Into C++ - Alex Allain
------
I wanted to learn C++ so I picked up a beginner book and worked through it.

The book is "Jumping into C++" written by Alex Allain, and these are the programs I wrote as I went through his book.

I've date stamped and given some info on what each program does in the header.
