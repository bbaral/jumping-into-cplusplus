# C++ Learning

*This is code I've written while learning C++. I'm probably not using best practices or the newest
C++11/14 features (YET!). This is repository for historical purposes, so that I can come back in the future
and see my early C++ code.*

These are just tiny little C++ programs I've written while learning the language. I've used a book called
"Jumping into C++" written by Alex Allain as a starting point, and these are the programs I've written as I
progress through his book.

I've date stamped and given some info on what each program does in the header. I was learning
new language features as I went, so the earlier programs aren't the best.
